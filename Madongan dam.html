    <p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Love the view of a wide looking falls. 
        Staying under the falling water is very relaxing.
        Love the birds eye view of the place too when went up the dam to see the top view. 
        The nice thing about the place is that there's no entrance fees and water is crystal clear. 
        You even get a free massage when you stay under the falling water. The place is definitely clean and the staff were friendly. 
        This makes me miss the true hospitality of my home town.
